Project Description:

In this project, a colleague and I used a dataset from the Computational Intelligence and Learning Cluster challenge from the year 2000.  Given a dataset with nearly 10,000 rows and 86 discrete variables, the challenge was to train various classifiers in the attempt to accurately predict the target variable: would an existing customer be a good candidate for targeted marketing for a caravan (mobile home) insurance policy?
